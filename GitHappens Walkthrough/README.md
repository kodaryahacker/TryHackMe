## Boss wanted me to create a prototype, so here it is! We even used something called ‚Äúversion control‚Äù that made deploying this really easy!

I started by downloading the git directory into my local kali machine using the command below.


```
wget -r --no-parent http://10.10.44.0/.git
```

The command recursively downloads the entire `.git` directory and its contents from the specified URL, avoiding traversal to parent directories.

```
cd <ip>
```

Navigate to the directory that was downloaded where you can find the `.git` directory.

```
git log
```

The `git log` command displays the commit history of the repository, showing details like commit hashes, authors, dates, and messages.

There was a commit made which says `Made the login page, boss!` . I felt it might hold the clue to our password.

```
git show <commit-hash>
```

The `git show` command displays detailed information about a specific commit, including changes made, the commit message, and metadata like the author and timestamp.

Successfully, found the password. It‚Äôs a very good beginner friendly room, try it out!! Happy Hacking!!!üßë‚Äçüíª
